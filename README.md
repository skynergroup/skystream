A modern, responsive streaming platform interface built with React.js that provides a feature-rich user experience for browsing and viewing movies, TV shows, and anime content. The application leverages The Movie Database (TMDB) API for comprehensive content metadata and integrates with multiple third-party streaming services.

### Design Patterns
- **Component-based architecture** with React functional components
- **Service layer pattern** for API interactions and business logic
- **Utility-first approach** with centralized configuration management
- **Single Page Application (SPA)** with client-side rendering

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18.x or higher
- npm or yarn package manager
- TMDB API Key (obtain from [themoviedb.org](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api))

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/skynergroup/skystream.git
cd skystream
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Configure environment variables:

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Add your TMDB API key to the `.env` file:
```env
VITE_TMDB_API_KEY=your_tmdb_api_key_here
VITE_TMDB_BASE_URL=https://api.themoviedb.org/3
VITE_TMDB_IMAGE_BASE_URL=https://image.tmdb.org/t/p
```

4. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

### Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run build:staging` - Build for staging environment
- `npm run build:production` - Build for production environment
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build locally
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint
- `npm run lint:fix` - Fix ESLint errors automatically
- `npm run format` - Format code with Prettier
- `npm run format:check` - Check code formatting

## Deployment

The application is deployed on Vercel and optimized for static hosting platforms.

### Vercel Deployment

1. Install Vercel CLI:
```bash
npm install -g vercel
```

2. Deploy to Vercel:
```bash
vercel
```

3. Configure environment variables in the Vercel dashboard:
   - `VITE_TMDB_API_KEY`
   - `VITE_GA_TRACKING_ID` (optional)

### Build Optimization

The production build includes:
- Code splitting with vendor, router, and icon chunks
- Asset optimization with hashed filenames
- Minification with Terser
- CSS code splitting
- Optimized bundle size with tree shaking

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Required | Default |
|----------|-------------|----------|---------|
| `VITE_TMDB_API_KEY` | TMDB API key for content data | Yes | - |
| `VITE_TMDB_BASE_URL` | TMDB API base URL | No | `https://api.themoviedb.org/3` |
| `VITE_TMDB_IMAGE_BASE_URL` | TMDB image CDN URL | No | `https://image.tmdb.org/t/p` |
| `VITE_GA_TRACKING_ID` | Google Analytics tracking ID | No | - |
| `VITE_ENABLE_ANALYTICS` | Enable/disable analytics | No | `true` |
| `VITE_DEFAULT_PLAYER` | Default video player | No | `videasy` |

## Performance

### Optimization Techniques
- Lazy loading of images with loading states
- Code splitting for reduced initial bundle size
- Optimized asset delivery with CDN
- Responsive images with multiple size options
- Debounced search input for reduced API calls
- Memoized components to prevent unnecessary re-renders

### Analytics & Monitoring
- Google Analytics for user behavior tracking
- Vercel Analytics for performance insights
- Custom event tracking for content interactions
- Error tracking and reporting
